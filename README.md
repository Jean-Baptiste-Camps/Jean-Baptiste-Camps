## About me 

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ! My name is *Jean-Baptiste Camps* and I'm an Associate Professor in Computational Philology at the Ã‰cole des chartes ([profile](https://github.com/chartes/)), where I lead the MA in Digital Humanities for UniversitÃ© PSL ([profile](https://github.com/Humanites-Numeriques-PSL/)). 

I like to code in **R**, **Python** or **XSLT**, and am interested in computational text analysis and IA for building large text corpora.

You might perhaps know me from my work on [Corneille and MoliÃ¨re](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aax5489) or [QAnon](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/19/technology/qanon-messages-authors.html).

ðŸ“« You can reach me on Twitter [@jbcamps](https://twitter.com/Jbcamps). 

Below is a selection of the favourite repositories to which I've contributed.
